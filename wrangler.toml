# This project is NOT compatible with Cloudflare Workers
#
# This is a full Node.js Express application that requires:
# - Long-running server process
# - PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
# - Redis for caching and queues
# - Scheduled cron jobs
# - Playwright browser automation with persistent state
# - File system access for cookies and browser data
#
# Cloudflare Workers are serverless functions with limitations:
# - No long-running processes
# - No file system
# - No native Node.js modules
# - Limited execution time (50ms-15min depending on plan)
#
